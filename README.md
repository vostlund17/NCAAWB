# NCAA Women's Basketball Analytics

This repository includes code from a personal project that I started purely to help develop my R skills.

My goal was to first obtain women's college basketball data through web scraping and then create an algorithm that would develop my own metric to measure the strength of a women's college basketball team (similar to adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency on kenpom.com).

#### This project is a work in progress
